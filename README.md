# scala-akka-101
    
Project to show my Scala learning adventure    
    
    A simple project to show the interactions between a Class of Student Instances and a Class of College Instances.     
        
        ( Please excuse the project structure :) )
        
        TODO List
        * Fix Class Hierarchies
            - The filename and class should be identical and segregated accordingly
        * Remove Random value generators from the Person Abstract Class and move to the Optools Object
        * Work in Akka
        * Test Complexity
